## Overview

This exercise involves refining the CSS styling to structure a webpage into a well-defined layout based on a given
design. The main objective is to adapt the existing webpage and improve its layout using CSS only, with minor
adjustments to the HTML where necessary.

## Task Description

1. **Starting Point**: Begin with the existing HTML and CSS files from the previous exercise.
2. **CSS Modifications**: Focus all style changes within the external stylesheet (`style.css`). Avoid inline styles
   within the HTML code.
3. **Layout Objectives**:
    - Ensure the page content width is 960 pixels.
    - Divide the main content area into two columns, with the left column approximately 20% larger than the right.
    - Split the "Lectures" section into two equally wide columns.
    - Place images to the left of the title and description in each lecture.
    - Apply a grey gradient background to the right column.
4. **HTML Adjustments** (if necessary, after consultation with the instructor):
    - Encapsulate the description and title of each lecture into a common block element.
    - Wrap the description and image of each exercise into a common block element.
    - Wrap the "Lectures" and "Results Overview" sections in a separate `div`.
    - Encapsulate the "Exercises" section in a distinct `div`.
    - Insert a separate `div` following the "Exercises" section for additional content.
    - Apply the same structuring approach to the footer sections ("Contact Us" and "Related Courses").
5. **Images and Colors**:
    - Employ a color palette of grey (#656565), light brown on light background (#b15e23), light brown on dark
      background (#d5a17c), dark brown (#3c1f0a), white, and black.
