## Overview

This exercise builds upon the previous HTML exercise by adding and refining CSS styles to enhance the webpage's
aesthetics and usability. You will create a `style.css` file to define the styles separately from the HTML structure,
adhering to modern web design best practices.

## Task Description

1. **Create CSS File**: Generate an empty `style.css` file and link it in the HTML document's head section.
2. **Style Rules**: Define CSS rules only within the `style.css` file. Direct inline styles within the HTML code should
   be avoided.
3. **Structure Modifications**:
    - Encapsulate the "About the Course" section within a div with a suitable identifier.
    - Wrap the "Lectures" to "Exercises" sections in a div tagged with an appropriate identifier.
    - Surround the "Contact Us" and "Related Courses" sections in a div with a relevant identifier.
4. **Styling Goals**:
    - Use Arial and Helvetica fonts for a clean, sans-serif look.
    - Implement a color scheme featuring gray (#656565), light brown on light background (#b15e23), light brown on dark
      background (#d5a17c), dark brown (#3c1f0a), white, and black.
    - Show small triangles under the menu on hover.
    - Apply dotted lines under lecture and exercise headers.
    - Style tables with defined colors, borders, and cell alignments.
    - Right-align contact email addresses, left-align labels, and visually format them into columns.
    - Use custom images for bullets in the "Related Courses" section.
