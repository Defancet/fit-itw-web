## Overview

This exercise focuses on enhancing a webpage with CSS3 features and making it responsive to fit various device screens.
Starting from the existing document, you will adjust the layout using CSS media queries to ensure the webpage displays
optimally across a range of devices from extra small to extra large.

## Task Description

1. **Update Styles**: Modify the existing CSS to improve responsiveness and maintain visual appeal across different
   devices.
2. **Media Queries**:
    - **Extra Small (xs)**: Below 576px - Content should stack in one column that takes 100% width.
    - **Small (sm)**: At least 576px - Similar to XS, maintain a single column layout.
    - **Medium (md)**: At least 768px - Split content into two columns in a 7:5 ratio (left:right).
    - **Large (lg)** and **Extra Large (xl)**: At least 992px and 1200px respectively - Three columns in a 4:4:4 ratio,
      with a max content width of 1200px.
3. **Design Specifications**:
    - **Fonts**: Use 'Ubuntu' and 'Roboto' from Google Fonts.
    - **Colors**: Maintain color consistency with previous exercises. Utilize colors like grey (#656565), white, light
      brown (#b15e23), and intense brown (#3c1f0a).
    - **Backgrounds**: Sections like "About the Course" and "Exercises" should have a gradient background transitioning
      from light gray to white.
4. **Responsiveness**:
    - Ensure the design is responsive without external libraries but explore frameworks like Bootstrap for future
      projects.
